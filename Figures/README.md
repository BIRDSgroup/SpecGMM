# Figures

This folder contains scripts to reproduce figures in the manuscript. Place these scripts in the SpecGMM folder and run them to generate the figures.

## Explanation

- Figure 1: Plots the discrete signal representation for a sample DNA subsequence using the Purine-Pyrimidine (PP) representation and its corresponding magnitude spectrum.

- Figure 2: Plots the average magnitude spectrum for magnitude spectra computed over sliding windows for two Primate species — Haplorhini and Strepsirrhini.

- Figure 3: Plots the mixture weights computed using UBMGMM for each training sequence in the Plants dataset as a heatmap. Also, it plots the mixture component means of the adapted GMMs for two representative sequences of the two Plant classes — Chlorophyta and Streptophyta.

- Figure 4: Plots the bar chart representing accuracies for different features obtained by averaging 16S rRNA HVR-based window posteriors at different taxonomy levels.

- Figure 5: Plots a spectrogram for a sequence of the species Bacillus Subtilis and finds the presence of the DNA subsequence between given windows.
